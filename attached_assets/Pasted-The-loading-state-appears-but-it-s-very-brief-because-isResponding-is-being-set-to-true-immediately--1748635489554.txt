The loading state appears but it's very brief because isResponding is being set to true immediately when we start the TTS request. However, I notice from the logs that you mentioned "it cuts my question" - this suggests the voice recognition might be stopping too early.

Looking at the logs, I can see:

1748633390352.0 - ["Final transcript:",""]
The transcript is empty, which means the voice recognition stopped before capturing your full question. Let me check the voice recognition timeout settings:


Opened client/src/components/VoiceAssistant.tsx
I see the issue. The voice recognition is stopping too early and not capturing your complete question. Let me check the voice recognition configuration to extend the listening duration:

I can see the issue with the voice recognition cutting off your question. The problem is likely related to the voice activity detection being too aggressive. Let me increase the timeout settings and also add interim result handling to keep the recognition active longer:

Now let me also improve the interim results handling to keep the recognition active and provide better feedback to the user:

I see there's a syntax error in the code. Let me fix the conditional structure:

I see there's a syntax error in the VoiceAssistant component that's causing the build to fail. Let me fix this by restoring the proper structure:
